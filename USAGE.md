# EvilBot 3000
### Possibly one of the worst Minecraft bots to ever exist.

EvilBot 3000 is a Minecraft "bot" that I made in about 6 hours (that explains the not-so-great mechanics and quality.)
Regardless, I'm quite proud of it. So let's get on to _how to use it._

## Crafting the "Bot Core"

To craft the "Bot Core", use the following recipe:

Emerald Block, Iron Block, Emerald Block
Iron Block x3
Iron Block, Emerald Block, Iron Block

You will receive a Nether Brick called the Bot Core.
Place the Nether Brick, and an armor stand will spawn to fight you.
You may have to move away from it at first (I can probably fix that), and it will attack you IMMEDIATELY upon spawning.

Each attack on the bot will deal AT LEAST 5.5 damage. The bot has a health of 1000.
Depending on the item you use to attack the bot, you will deal more (or less) damage.
**Damage Key:**
- Diamond Sword: +22.5
- Gold Sword: +15.2
- Iron Sword: +9.5
- Stone Sword: +5
- Wood Sword: +3.5
- Bow/Arrow: +10

When the bot dies, you will get a message, and if you look up, you'll see an amazing explosion!

I hope you enjoy this plugin! It was a bit rushed, but I didn't have much time. I still think it's pretty good though.
